### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

3. View quick visual summary

   After uploading and processing files, download the CSV and view the "Quick Visual Summary" section under the "Download Results" area. It provides:

   - A bar chart of average item means (per survey question).
   - A line chart of Overall rating over time (Semester + Year).

These charts are generated automatically from the processed CSV and provide an at-a-glance look at instructor performance.
